Token strategy

When you REGISTER, a token is generated and added to your schema. DONE

When you LOGIN, it checks the username and password
then returns that token,
and saves it to your localStorage.

Then, on pages that require a login (such as PROFILE),
it loads it the token from localStorage,
and if it matches the token in your profile, you can access that page
